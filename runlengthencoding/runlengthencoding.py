"""This module provides a pair of functions for converting lists to and from a
"run length encoding" format, where successive runs of the same value are
represented by that value and a count of how many times in a row it should
appear.

For example, the list [1, 1, 3, 1] in run-length encoded form is
[[1, 2], [3, 1], [1, 1]].

run_length_encode should take a list and produce a run length encoded version
of that list. run_length_decode should then take a run length encoded list and
return the original list that would have produced it.
